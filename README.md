Title:  Alpha/beta power changes during memory encoding with multimodal rhythmic stimulation

Abstract: Prior studies suggest that an alpha/beta power decrease during encoding is positively associated with later remembering. While alpha/beta power decrease was repeatedly revealed during memory tasks, less is known about whether the effect can be observed in a rhythmic multisensory stimulation paradigm. We contrasted alpha/beta power between successful and unsuccessful encoding in a multimodal associative memory task with 49 participants. Audio and video stimuli were phase manipulated at 4 Hz during EEG acquisition. We predicted stronger alpha/beta (8 â€“ 30 Hz) power decreases during successful encoding in prefrontal, temporal and occipital regions. Fourier Transform was used for time-frequency decomposition and power spectrum. Non-parametric cluster permutation test revealed a negative cluster, indicating a difference effect in alpha/beta power between later remembered and forgotten memories. We observed a greater decrease in alpha/beta power during successful encoding when contrasted with unsuccessful encoding. This suggests that subsequent memory effect is generalizable within a multisensory rhythmic stimulation paradigm. Implications of the findings for clinical populations are discussed.
